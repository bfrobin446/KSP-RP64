# RP-64: A realistic vision of the Kerbol system

RP-64 is my attempt to curate a Kerbal Space Program experience that includes
realistic mechanics and limitations, but retains more of the stock aesthetic
and more compatibility with other mods than a total conversion like RP-1.

## What's included

### Sigma Dimensions at 6.4x scale

A larger solar system allows more realistically-proportioned rockets and more
realistic ascent profiles. Most launch vehicles won't have to coast and then
restart their engines just to make low Kerbin orbit.

### Engines by Real Fuels

### Life support and science by Kerbalism

### Satellites-first tech tree

Putting an uncrewed satellite into orbit should be easier than putting a kerbal
into space.

### ElectricCharge rebalance

Kerbalism and Real Antennas have adopted Realism Overhaul's convention that
one unit of ElectricCharge represents one kilojoule of energy. Batteries and
generators will have their capacities adjusted to match.
