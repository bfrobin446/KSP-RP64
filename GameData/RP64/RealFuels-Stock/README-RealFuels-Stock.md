#RealFuels-stock

This directory originated as a standalone pack last published by ValiZockt
based on earlier work by Raptor831. As of this writing, the published version
is available at https://github.com/ValiZockt/RealFuels-Stock/tree/v5.1.0.
ValiZockt's last release was in August 2020, and I've made significant changes
in my personal installs, so I've decided to maintain my own copy instead of
depending on the previously-published package.
