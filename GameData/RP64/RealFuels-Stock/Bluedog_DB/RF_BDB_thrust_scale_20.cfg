// Most engines in BDB are scaled to 25% of the thrust of the full-scale
// engine. Since the BlueSmurff patch gives us better mass ratios than BDB
// provides at stock scale, we get more realistic TWRs with a scale factor of
// 20%.
// BDB does have a few engines that are exceptions to the normal 25% scaling,
// mostly long-burning upper stages that needed higher thrust at smaller system
// scales. Keep an eye out for engines that aren't playing well with this
// rescaling.
