RealFuels-Stock for BDB 1.7
Current State: RELEASE CANDIDATE  - pending BDB 1.7 release


These are engine and tank configurations for BDB 1.7dev up to the CentaurD RL10 addition even though RealFuels is pretty incompatible with B9PartSwitch configurations but most of it is working. 

Configs are based on the configs in BD_Extras although they've been completely overhauled since there's been a lot of changes to BDB since that was released. Some older configs are in the DEPRECATED folder for backwards compatability. 

Variable tank sizes from newer BDB parts using B9PartSwitch aren't supported. As a workaround each tank is duplicated, sensibly renamed and their B9PartSwitch selection limited. 

All engines featured in BDB 1.7dev have RF versions of their B9 configs including appropriate variant fuels such as the HDA 8096 and RP-1 powered Titan engines configured. There's even a few extra configs and more variants are planned based on spelunking through RO configs and Astronautix* I hope in the future to have engine type and and bell switching affect performance on their own so you could use the 8096 HDA engine with the 8041 bell and it'd have better performance but loose a lot of effiency because of the smaller bell size. Don't know why you would want to though...

All engines make use of techlevels for fine tuning (requires a lot of balancing though, some b) and their subtype requirements have the appropriate tech requirement.

Nearly all the RCS should be flexible in its configuration and have appropriate tech requirements.

Thrust is based on BDB values and scaled RO values for extra configs. Currently testing whether each historical vehicle can fullfill the Historic Mission Contract pack launched with MechJebs PEG Ascent Guidance or Gravity Turn @3.2x scale.

*Could possibly future proof for future BDB updates as well as provide a base for any mods with engines based on real engines.

An optional patch for TAC users with 24h days is available. Consumption rates are divided by 4 as the supplies added by BDB TAC patches are based on 6h days but only works on a new game.
